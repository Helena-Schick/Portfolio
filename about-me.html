                I am a digital tech student at Mount Albert Grammar School. 
                I live with my parents, slightly annoying younger brother and an adorable cat named Colin. 
                As a sport I do archery, where I am on the MAGS team. 
                In my spare time I enjoy painting and reading and I have been teaching myself how to code games.
